🔮 BAYESIAN NETWORKS FOR MODELLING 🦢 "BLACK SWAN" FINANCIAL EVENTS 🦢, inspired by Riccardo Rebonato and Alexander Denev's work on portfolio management under stress. 😖
👆 Can an 🤖 LLM help build the graph,leaving the 🤔 intuition about 🎲 conditional probabilities to the 🕵️ human? (Not my idea. See comments.)

The project explores two scenarios: the HYPOTHETICAL EUROZONE BREAKUP from the 2010s (demonstrating the R&D methodology) and the 🆕 2025 TRUMP TARIFFS scenario 📊 (representing a real-time risk as globalization potentially reverses from its post-2000 peak).

We see how causal modeling handles uncertainty differently than traditional correlation-based approaches. Instead of relying solely on historical patterns that often break down during crises 📉, this framework lets you reason about how unprecedented events might unfold by understanding the underlying cause-and-effect relationships 🔗.

A few takeaways that resonated:

💡 Expert judgment matters when historical precedent is limited
🎯 Understanding causality helps navigate regime changes better than correlations alone
🔮 Forward-looking scenario analysis complements backward-looking statistical models
🛡️ Different black swan events require different portfolio responses
🕵️ The AI can help build the graph, but humans have the edge for reasoning about probabilities

The code and analysis are built on well-established probabilistic graphical models - nothing revolutionary, just careful application of existing methodology to current questions. It's a reminder that sometimes the most useful work is taking proven techniques and applying them thoughtfully to specific problems 🔧.

For anyone working in risk management or portfolio allocation 📈, these causal modeling approaches offer another lens for thinking about tail risks and stress scenarios. Always valuable to have multiple perspectives when dealing with uncertainty.
